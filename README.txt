# New_Glava
An update to Glava. This version is currently working (at least it is on my computer). Implemented fixes to code and created a python script to install necessary dependencies. Code will be using my preferred settings by default...

# Installation
Installing Glava is pretty simple. Just run the glava_setup.py script in the terminal.
ex.

```
  python3 glava_setup.py
```

Their version isn't working properly on debian devices so please feel free to download these fixes that have been implemented by me and other programmers.
